<h1 class="entry-title">M1 Pro vs M1 Max: Apple has already delivered a chip that’s too fast</h1>			
 <div class="subheadline">
				The extra power of the M1 Max might not be worth the extra price.			</div>
	
<p>	One of the most interesting wrinkles about Apple’s new MacBook Pros is that the company offers them with two different chips. At first glance, you might assume that the more expensive M1 Max chip is simply a bigger, faster, more powerful chip than the less expensive M1 Pro—but looks can be deceiving. The two new chips are closely related, and depending on the kind of work you do with your MacBook Pro, the extra power of the M1 Max might not be worth the extra price.
